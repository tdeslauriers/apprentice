# Apprentice

**Description:** a service for tracking, managing, and persisting tasks/chores data. It is part of the larger family website and sits behind the gateway service [erebor](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/erebor). It began as an allowance tracking application only, but I quickly hijacked it to track my own tasks as well. This 3rd iteration focuses on task management more, but still tracks and automates allowances.

- Apprentice utilizes my [carapace](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/carapace) project for core functionality.

**Name**: _Building a todo list is universal demo project when taking beginner level coding courses. So since this is effectively a todo list, I thought 'apprentice' suited it._
